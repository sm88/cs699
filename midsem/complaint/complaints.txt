Enter the text of your complaints below, only in the space provided.
Be brief.

Also, for each complaint, provide a revised/correct script, which is a
minimal modification of your original script.  I will manually check
each modification against your original submission, and permit only
those which involve 'minor' changes (e.g. forgot a semicolon, used a
gnuplot command which works only in newer versions).

I had added an echo for debugging purposes(line 68) that I overlooked. Thus when the output was piped to gnuplot that extra text was also sent and resulted in error.
Anyway, the .eps file is generating both via directly running my file as well as test script. The gnuplot version on my linux box is "gnuplot 4.4 patchlevel 3". I have made a mistake in checking for title environment variable(line 48, added a NOT) but that was for 2 marks only.
So finally, the original script is giving correct result for 4 marks.
