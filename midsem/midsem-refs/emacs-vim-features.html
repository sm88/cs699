<h2>Cool and fast things you can do with emacs and vim</h2>


<h2>Emacs</h2>


  <ul type="circle">
  <li> My topmost reason: auto-complete; while editing text or tex or code, if there's a long word or variable name, just typing the first 2-3 characters and hitting alt-/ will complete it!  This works nicely even when there are multiple possible completions.
  </li>
  <li> Auto-indent while typing, or later: for Java, C, C++, Perl, Python, bash, LISP, tex, text, html ... the list is endless
</li>
  <li> Indent a selected region of code or text. </li>
  <li> Comment a region of (latex, C, C++, Java, bash, python, ... anything)
</li>
  <li> Uncomment a region of ... anything
</li>
  <li> Integration with ispell to spell-check tex or text documents
  </li>
  <li>Use of kill rings to easily paste something which was cut long back
  </li>
  <li>Delete forward word, delete backward word</li>
  <li>Delete forward sentence</li>
  <li>Go to end or beginning of function definition, while editing code</li>
  <li> Bibtex integration with emacs: can insert different types of bibtex entries with a single click
</li>
  <li> Cscope integration with emacs: keyboard shortcuts for all cscope functionalities
</li>
  <li>You can run emacs from within a terminal as well as using X-windows: very useful for (slow) remote logins.
  </li>
  <li> Regular expression search and replace, optionally only in a selected region, and also optionally with confirmation.
  </li>
  <li> You can split a window into multiple edit windows, horizontally or vertically.  You can even have multiple emacs windows.  This is very useful if I want to simultaneously look at different parts of the same document (e.g. I want to look at a structure definition, which is there at the top of file f.c, in one window, while adding code to it in the bottom of f.c in another window)
  <li>Customizable colours and fonts.
  </li>
  <li>Save desktop state to continue from where you left off last time.
  </li>
  <li> Repeat a particular typing N times </li>
  <li> Repeat the previous command </li>
  <li> Built-in help </li>
  <li> Define macros, execute macros any number of times </li>
  <li> You can run a shell from within emacs!
</li>
  <li> Emacs is extensible; there are add-ons for almost anything: email, www browsing, debugger, games, doctor, ...
</li>
  <li> Has a binary mode: useful to view non-ASCII files if you want!
  </li>
  </li></ul>


<h2>Vim</h2>


  <ul type="circle">


  <li> Integration with cscope. </li>
  <li> Search and replace regular expressions, optionally for a set of line numbers; most sed based commands are supported. </li>
  <li> Faster than emacs: useful for quick editing. </li>
  <li> Can use from within a terminal or using X-windows: very useful in (slow) remote login sessions. </li>
  <li>Visual mode of editing: useful for editing columns, like in a spreadsheet!</li>
  <li> Repeat a particular typing N times </li>
  <li> Repeat previous command </li>
  <li> Auto/Smart-indent is possible. If you can configure the .vimrc file, it can be enabled by default. Else, use set ai in the command mode.</li>
  <li> Intuitive commands for various functions like save, etc.</li>
  <li> Built-in demo. </li>
  <li> Customizable syntax highlighting (again you need to modify the .vimrc file).
  <li> I'm not as much a vim fan as much as I'm an emacs fan; others can add more here.</li>
  </li></ul>
