<h3>SED Tutorial | Learn Linux SED</h3>
<ul>
<li>The sed utility is an "editor"
<li>It is also noninteractive. This means you have to insert commands to be executed on the data at the command line or in a script to be processed.
<li>sed accepts a series of commands and executes them on a file (or set of files).
<li>sed fittingly stands for stream editor.
<li>It can be used to change all occurrences (for example... in a file) of "SAD" to "SED" or "New York" to "Newport."
<li>The stream editor is ideally suited to performing repetitive edits that would take considerable time if done manually.
</ul>

<P>
<b>How sed Works</b>
</P>
<P>

The sed utility works by sequentially reading a file, line by line,
 into memory. It then performs all actions specified for the line

and places the line back in memory to dump to the terminal with the

requested changes made. After all actions have taken place to this

one line, it reads the next line of the file and repeats the

process until it is finished with the file, the

output can be redirected to another file to save the changes;

second, the original file, by default, is left unchanged. The

default is for sed to read the entire file and make changes to each

line within it.
</P>
<P>

<b>The syntax for the utility is:</b>
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
sed [options] '{command}' [filename]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
In this tutorial we will walk through the most commonly used commands
and options and illustrate how they work and where they would be
appropriate for use.
</P>
<P>

<b>The Substitute Command</b>
</P>
<P>
One of the most common uses of the sed utility, and any similar

editor, is to substitute one value for another. To accomplish this,

the syntax for the command portion of the operation is:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
sed 's/{old value}/{new value}/'
s/regular-expression/replacement text/{flags}
</pre>
<table border=1>
<tr ><td colspan=2>The flags can be any of the following:</td></tr>
<tr><td>n</td><td> replace nth instance of pattern with replacement</td></tr>
<tr><td>g</td><td> replace all instances of pattern with replacement</td></tr>
<tr><td>p</td><td> write pattern space to STDOUT if a successful substitution takes place</td></tr>
<tr><td>w</td><td> file Write the pattern space to file if a successful substitution takes place </td></tr>
</table>

</P>
<P>
Thus, the following illustrates how "replace" can be changed to "replace with sed" very simply:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ echo "learn replace" | sed 's/replace/replace with sed/'
$ learn replace with sed
</PRE>
</P>


<P>
Notice that it is not necessary to specify a filename if input is

being derived from the output of a preceding command the same

as is true for awk, sort, and most other Linux/UNIX command-line

utility programs.
</P>
<p>
To replace contents of file "myfile.txt" (note original file is not changed)
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed 's/replace/replace with sed/' myfile.txt
 learn replace with sed
</PRE>
</p>

<P>


<b>Multiple Changes</b>
</P><P>
If multiple changes need to be made to the same file or line, there

are three methods by which this can be accomplished. The first is

to use the "-e" option, which informs the program that more than

one editing command is being used. For example:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ echo "The linux group will release code after 4:00 PM" | sed -e '
   s/linux/unix/' -e 's/after/before/'
The unix group will release code before 4:00 PM
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This is pretty much the long way of going about it, and the "-e"

option is not commonly used to any great extent. A more preferable

way is to separate command with semicolons:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ echo "The linux group will release code after 4:00 PM" | sed '
   s/linux/unix/; s/after/before/'
The unix group will release code before 4:00 PM
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Notice that the semicolon must be the next character following the

slash. If a space is between the two, the operation will not

successfully complete and an error message will be returned.
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ echo "The linux group will release code after 4:00 PM" | sed '
> s/linux/unix/
> s/after/before/'
The unix group will release code before 4:00 PM
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<b>Global Changes</b>
</P>
<P>
Let's begin with a deceptively simple edit. Suppose the message

that is to be changed contains more than one occurrence of the item

to be changed. By default, the result can be different than what

was expected, as the following illustrates:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ echo "The linux group will release code (linux2.5.6) after 4:00 PM" |
sed 's/linux/unix/'
The unix group will release code (linux2.5.6) after 4:00 PM
$</PRE>
</p>
<P>
To make changes of both occurances of linux we can use a flag "g" as below
<PRE class=indent>
$ echo "The linux group will release code (linux2.5.6) after 4:00 PM" |
sed 's/linux/unix/g'
The unix group will release code (unix2.5.6) after 4:00 PM
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<b>Selective changes</b><br>
If you only want to make a change if certain

conditions are met for example, following a match of some

other data. To illustrate, consider the following text file:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ cat myfile.txt
one     1
two     1
three   1
one     1
two     1
two     1
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Suppose that it would be desirable for "1" to be substituted with

"2," but only after the word "two" and not throughout every line.

This can be accomplished by specifying that a match is to be found

before giving the substitute command:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '/two/ s/1/2/' myfile.txt
one     1
two     2
three   1
one     1
two     2
two     2
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
And now, to make it even more accurate:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '
> /two/ s/1/2/
> /three/ s/1/3/' myfile.txt
one     1
two     2
three   3
one     1
two     2
two     2
three   3
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The original file, it is the same as it always was.

You must save the output to another file to create permanence like..
<pre>
$ sed '
> /two/ s/1/2/
> /three/ s/1/3/' myfile.txt >out.txt
</pre>

</P>
<P>
The output file has all the changes.
</P>
<P>

<b>Script Files</b>
</P>
<P>
The sed tool allows you to create a script file containing commands

that are processed from the file, rather than at the command line,

and is referenced via the "-f" option. By creating a script file,

you have the ability to run the same operations over and over

again, and to specify far more detailed operations than what you

would want to try to tackle from the command line each time.
</P>
<P>

Consider the following script file:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ cat sedlist
/two/ s/1/2/
/three/ s/1/3/
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
It can now be used on the data file to obtain the same results we

saw earlier:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed -f sedlist myfile.txt
one     1
two     2
three   3
one     1
two     2
two     2
three   3
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Notice that apostrophes are not used inside the source file, or

from the command line when the "-f" option is invoked. Script

files, also known as source files, are invaluable for operations

that you intend to repeat more than once and for complicated

commands where there is a possibility that you may make an error at

the command line. It is far easier to edit the source file and

change one character than to retype a multiple-line entry at the

command line.
</P>
<P>

<b>Restricting Lines</b>
</P>
<P>
The default is for the editor to look at, and for editing to take

place on, every line that is input to the stream editor. This can

be changed by specifying restrictions preceding the command. For

example, to substitute "1" with "2" only in the fifth and sixth

lines of the sample file's output, the command would be:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '5,6 s/1/2/' myfile.txt
one     1
two     1
three   1
one     1
two     2
two     2
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
In this case, since the lines to changes were specifically

specified, the substitute command was not needed. Thus you have the

flexibility of choosing which lines to changes (essentially,

restricting the changes) based upon matching criteria that can be

either line numbers or a matched pattern.
</P>
<P>

<b>Prohibiting the Display</b>
</P>
<P>
The default is for sed to display on the screen (or to a file, if

so redirected) every line from the original file, whether it is

affected by an edit operation or not; the "-n" parameter overrides

this action. "-n" overrides all printing and displays no lines

whatsoever, whether they were changed by the edit or not. For

example:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed -n -f sedlist myfile.txt
$

$ sed -n -f sedlist myfile.txt > sample_two
$ cat sample_two
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
In the first example, nothing is displayed on the screen. In the

second example, nothing is changed, and thus nothing is written to

the new file it ends up being empty. Doesn't this negate the

whole purpose of the edit? Why is this useful? It is useful only

because the "-n" option has the ability to be overridden by a print

command (-p). To illustrate, suppose the script file were modified

to now resemble the following:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ cat sedlist
/two/ s/1/2/p
/three/ s/1/3/p
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Then this would be the result of running it:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed -n -f sedlist myfile.txt
two     2
three   3
two     2
two     2
three   3
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Lines that stay the same as they were are not displayed at all.

Only the lines affected by the edit are displayed.  In this manner,

it is possible to pull those lines only, make the changes, and

place them in a separate file:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed -n -f sedlist myfile.txt > sample_two
$

$ cat sample_two
two     2
three   3
two     2
two     2
three   3
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Another method of utilizing this is to print only a set number of

lines. For example, to print only lines two through six while

making no other editing changes:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed -n '2,6p' myfile.txt
two     1
three   1
one     1
two     1
two     1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
All other lines are ignored, and only lines two through six are

printed as output. This is something remarkable that you cannot do

easily with any other utility. head will print the top of a file,

and tail will print the bottom, but sed allows you to pull anything

you want to from anywhere.
</P>
<P>

<b>Deleting Lines</b>
</P>
<P>
Substituting one value for another is far from the only function

that can be performed with a stream editor. There are many more

possibilities, and the second-most-used function in my opinion is

delete. Delete works in the same manner as substitute, only it

removes the specified lines (if you want to remove a word and not a

line, don't think of deleting, but think of substituting it for

nothing<TT>s/cat//</TT>).
</P>
<P>

The syntax for the command is:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
'{what to find} d'
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
To remove all of the lines containing "two" from the myfile.txt

file:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '/two/ d' myfile.txt
one     1
three   1
one     1
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
To remove the first three lines from the display, regardless of

what they are:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '1,3 d' myfile.txt
one     1
two     1
two     1
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Only the remaining lines are shown, and the first three cease to

exist in the display. There are several things to keep in mind with

the stream editor as they relate to global expressions in general,

and as they apply to deletions in particular:

</P>
<P>

<LI> The up carat (^) signifies the beginning of a line, thus
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
sed '/^two/ d' myfile.txt
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
   would only delete the line if "two" were the first three

characters of the line.</LI>

<LI> The dollar sign ($) represents the end of the file, or the end

of a line, thus
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
sed '/two$/ d' myfile.txt
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
would delete the line only if "two" were the last three characters

of the line.</LI>

</P>
<P>

The result of putting these two together:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
sed '/^$/ d' {filename}
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
deletes all blank lines from a file. For example, the following

substitutes "1" for "2" as well as "1" for "3" and removes any

trailing lines in the file:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '/two/ s/1/2/; /three/ s/1/3/; /^$/ d' myfile.txt
one     1
two     1
three   1
one     1
two     2
two     2
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
A common use for this is to delete a header. The following command

will delete all lines in a file, from the first line through to the

first blank line:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
sed '1,/^$/ d' {filename}
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<b>Appending and Inserting Text</b>
</P>
<P>
Text can be appended to the end of a file by using sed with the "a"

option. This is done in the following manner:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '$a
> This is where we stop
> the test' myfile.txt
one     1
two     1
three   1
one     1
two     1
two     1
three   1
This is where we stop
the test
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Within the command, the dollar sign ($) signifies that the text is

to be appended to the end of the file. The backslashes () are

necessary to signify that a carriage return is coming. If they are

left out, an error will result proclaiming that the command is

garbled; anywhere that a carriage return is to be entered, you must

use the backslash.
</P>
<P>

To append the lines into the fourth and fifth positions instead of

at the end, the command becomes:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '3a
> This is where we stop
> the test' myfile.txt
one     1
two     1
three   1
This is where we stop
the test
one     1
two     1
two     1
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This appends the text after the third line. As with almost any

editor, you can choose to insert rather than append if you so

desire. The difference between the two is that append follows the

line specified, and insert starts with the line specified. When

using insert instead of append, just replace the "a" with an "i,"

as shown below:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '3i
> This is where we stop
> the test' myfile.txt
one     1
two     1
This is where we stop
the test
three   1
one     1
two     1
two     1
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The new text appears in the middle of the output, and processing

resumes normally after the specified operation is carried out.
</P>
<P>

<b>Reading and Writing Files</b>
</P>
<P>
The ability to redirect the output has already been illustrated,

but it needs to be pointed out that files can be read in and

written out to simultaneously during operation of the editing

commands. For example, to perform the substitution and write the

lines between one and three to a file called sample_three:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '
> /two/ s/1/2/
> /three/ s/1/3/
> 1,3 w sample_three' myfile.txt
one     1
two     2
three   3
one     1
two     2
two     2
three   3
$

$ cat sample_three
one     1
two     2
three   3
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Only the lines specified are written to the new file, thanks to the

"1,3" specification given to the w (write) command. Regardless of

those written, all lines are displayed in the default output.
</P>
<P>

<b>The Change Command</b>
</P>
<P>
In addition to substituting entries, it is possible to change the

lines from one value to another. The thing to keep in mind is that

substitute works on a character-for-character basis, whereas change

functions like delete in that it affects the entire line:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '/two/ c
> We are no longer using two' myfile.txt
one     1
We are no longer using two
three   1
one     1
We are no longer using two
We are no longer using two
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Working much like substitute, the change command is greater in

scale completely replacing the one entry for another,

regardless of character content, or context. At the risk of

overstating the obvious, when substitute was used, then only the

character "1" was replaced with "2," while when using change, the

entire original line was modified. In both situations, the match to

look for was simply the "two."
</P>
<P>

<b>Change All but...</b>
</P>
<P>
With most sed commands, the functions are spelled out as to what

changes are to take place. Using the exclamation mark, it is

possible to have the changes take place everywhere but those

specified completely reversing the default operation.
</P>
<P>

For example, to delete all lines that contain the phrase "two," the

operation is:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '/two/ d' myfile.txt
one     1
three   1
one     1
three   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
And to delete all lines except those that contain the phrase "two,"

the syntax becomes:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '/two/ !d' myfile.txt
two     1
two     1
two     1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If you have a file that contains a list of items and want to

perform an operation on each of the items in the file, then it is

important that you first do an intelligent scan of those entries

and think about what you are doing. To make matters easier, you can

do so by combining sed with any iteration routine (for, while,

until).
</P>
<P>

As an example, assume you have a text file named "animals" with the

following entries:
</P>
<P>

pig<BR>
horse<BR>
elephant<BR>
cow<BR>
dog<BR>
cat
</P>
<P>

And you want to run the following routine:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
#mcd.ksh
for I in $*
do
echo Old McDonald had a $I
echo E-I, E-I-O
done
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The result will be that each line is printed at the end of "Old

McDonald has a." While this is correct for the majority of the

entries, it is grammatically incorrect for the "elephant" entry, as

the result should be "an elephant" rather than "a elephant." Using

sed, you can scan the output from your shell file for such

grammatical errors and correct them on the fly, by first creating a

file of commands:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
#sublist
/ a a/ s/ a / an /
/ a e/ s/ a / an /
/a i/ s / a / an /
/a o/ s/ a / an /
/a u/ s/ a / an /
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
and then executing the process as follows:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sh mcd.ksh 'cat animals' | sed -f sublist
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Now, after the mcd script has been run, sed will scan the output

for anywhere that the single letter a (space, "a," space) is

followed by a vowel. If such exists, it will change the sequence to

space, "an," space. This corrects the problem before it ever prints

on the screen and ensures that editors everywhere sleep easier at

night. The result is:
</P>
<P>
Old McDonald had a pig<BR>
E-I, E-I-O<BR>
Old McDonald had a horse<BR>
E-I, E-I-O<BR>
Old McDonald had an elephant<BR>
E-I, E-I-O<BR>
Old McDonald had a cow<BR>
E-I, E-I-O<BR>
Old McDonald had a dog<BR>
E-I, E-I-O<BR>
Old McDonald had a cat<BR>
E-I, E-I-O
</P>
<P>

<b>Quitting Early</b>
</P>
<P>
The default is for sed to read through an entire file and stop only

when the end is reached. You can stop processing early, however, by

using the quit command. Only one quit command can be specified, and

processing will continue until the condition calling the quit

command is satisfied.
</P>
<P>

For example, to perform substitution only on the first five lines

of a file and then quit:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '
> /two/ s/1/2/
> /three/ s/1/3/
> 5q' myfile.txt
one     1
two     2
three   3
one     1
two     2
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The entry preceding the quit command can be a line number, as

shown, or a find/matching command like the following:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '
> /two/ s/1/2/
> /three/ s/1/3/
> /three/q' myfile.txt
one     1
two     2
three   3
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
You can also use the quit command to view lines beyond a standard

number and add functionality that exceeds those in head. For

example, the head command allows you to specify how many of the

first lines of a file you want to see—the default number is

ten, but any number can be used from one to ninety-nine. If you

want to see the first 110 lines of a file, you cannot do so with

head, but you can with sed:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
sed 110q filename
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<b>Handling Problems</b>
</P>
<P>
The main thing to keep in mind when dealing with sed is how it

works. It works by reading one line in, performing all the tasks it

knows to perform on that one line, and then moving on to the next

line. Each line is subjected to every editing command given.
</P>
<P>

This can be troublesome if the order of your operations is not

thoroughly thought out. For example, suppose you need to change all

"two" entries to "three" and all "three" to "four":
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '
> /two/ s/two/three/
> /three/ s/three/four/' myfile.txt
one     1
four     1
four   1
one     1
four     1
four     1
four   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The very first "two" read was changed to "three." It then meets the

criteria established for the next edit and becomes "four." The end

result is not what was wanted there are now no entries but

"four" where there should be "three" and "four."
</P>
<P>

When performing such an operation, you must pay diligent attention

to the manner in which the operations are specified and arrange

them in an order in which one will not clobber another. For

example:
</P>
<P>
<PRE class=indent>
$ sed '
> /three/ s/three/four/
> /two/ s/two/three/' myfile.txt
one     1
three     1
four   1
one     1
three     1
three     1
four   1
$
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This works perfectly, since the "three" value is changed prior to
