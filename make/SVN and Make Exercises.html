<h2>SVN and Make Exercises</h2>

<p><b>Example C/C++ program:</b></p>

<p>

</p><ul>
  <li>As a precursor, write a simple example C or C++ program.
  </li>
  <li>Do not copy this program from somewhere or from some friend: you
      should write it yourself.
  </li>
  <li>It should consist of at least one header file and at
      least three C/C++ files.
  </li>
  <li>The header file should be included in at least two of the C/C++
  files.
  </li>
  <li>All these files should reside in a
      particular directory (called cprog henceforth in this document for
      convenience; you can call it whatever you want).
  </li>
  <li>You may have
      sub-directories within the main parent directory.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example Latex report (necessary only for the make exercise):</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Also as a precursor, write an example latex report.
  </li>
  <li>The report should consist of at least three latex files
  including the main latex file (which includes the other latex files).
  </li>
  <li>The report should also consist of a bib file which is to be
  included after compilation using the "bibliography" command in the
  main latex file.
  </li>
  <li>All of the above files should reside within a directory (called
  latexrep henceforth in this document for convenience; you can call
  it whatever you want).
  </li>
  <li>The report should also include at least two xfig figures
  included as eps within one of the latex files.  The figures should
  reside in a sub-directory called figures.
  </li>
  <li>The report should also include at least two eps graphs generated
  from a gnuplot script; the plots should involve at least three data
  files from where the data is plotted.  The graphs should reside in a
  sub-directory called graphs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>SVN Exercises</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create an svn repository
  </li>
  <li>Import the entire C/C++ program directory into the SVN
  repository.  You can now delete the entire directory from which you
  made the import (don't delete the repository!).
  </li>
  <li>Now checkout the entire directory in a directory called copy1.
  Also checkout the entire directory in another directory called
  copy2.  (Imagine that copy2 is being edited by your colleague who is
  jointly working on the C program).
  </li>
  <li>Make some changes in some file(s) of copy1 and commit these
  changes to the svn repository.  And then checkout in copy2 to see if
  these changes are reflected.
  </li>
  <li>Make some "simultaneous" changes to the same file in copy1 and
  copy2.  But ensure that the changes are to different parts of the
  file (say in two different functions).  Now commit both changes.
  Now when you do svn update in copy1 (or copy2) automatic merging
  must take place.  Observe this.
  </li>
  <li>Do the same exercise as above, but create a conflict.  For
  instance, change the same set of lines in copy1 and copy2.  Observe
  how, when you do svn update in copy1 (or copy2), svn will try to
  merge, but report a conflict.  Now resolve the conflict manually (by
  editing the file) and commit the resolved version.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [1 HP]:</span>Create a situation where
  svn reports a successful merge, but the resultant C program has
      syntax errors (does not compile).
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [1 HP]:</span>Create a situation where svn reports a successful merge, the
  resultant C program compiles, but fails to link (linker error).
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [2 HP]:</span>Create a situation where svn reports a successful merge, the
  resultant C program compiles and links, but has a logical bug.
  </li>
  <li>Use the svn log command to view the log of changes to a
  particular file.
  </li>
  <li>Use the svn diff command to view the set of changes between the
  working copy version and any particular revision in the svn
  repository.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat some or all of the above commands by checking out copy2
  on a different machine, and using the appropriate repository
  specification (use svn+ssh).  Note that you do not have to specify
  the repository explicitly after the initial checkout, since its
  stored in the .svn directory!
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Submission instructions:</b>svn submissions must be as a single
tar.gz created from the parent directory of the svn repository
directory.  Upload the submission to moodle.  For the optional
questions carrying house points, you must show your submission
(downloaded from moodle) to one of the TAs or the instructor in the
lab.</p>

<h3>Make Exercises</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Write an appropriate Makefile for the C program.
      <ol class="a">
	<li>Modify one or more of the source files or header files and check
	    that running "make" executes only the necessary commands.  Do this
	    for multiple scenarios (modify different sets of files each time).<br>
	    Learn to use the "touch" command to "pretend" to have modified a
	    file.  This is sometimes useful to force recompilation without
	    actually modifying the source file(s).
	</li>
	<li>Delete one or more object files and/or the executable file.
	    Check that running "make" executes only the necessary commands.  Do
	    this for multiple scenarios (delete different sets of files each
	    time).
	</li>
	<li>Now add the Makefile to the SVN repository using "svn add"
	</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Write an appropriate Makefile for the latex report.  Your final
  target should be a PDF file of the report.  Note that you will have
  to use the following commands appropriately in the Makefile recipes:
  latex, bibtex, pdflatex (or dvips followed by ps2pdf), fig2eps (or
  convert), gnuplot.
      <ol class="a">
	<li>Like for the C program, modify or touch various sets of
  files (latex source, bib file, figure sources, gnuplot data files,
  gnuplot script files) and verify that running "make" executes only
  the required commands and generates the correct PDF.
	</li>
	<li>Like for the C program, delete various sets of the
  following files: dvi, pdf, ps, figure eps, graph eps.  Verify that
  running "make" executes only the required commands and generates the
  correct PDF.
	</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Make the following enhancements to each of the above
      Makefile scenarios.  For each enhancement, do not forget
      to check if running "make" is indeed executing only the
      required commands.
      <ol class="a">
	
	<li>Enhance the Makefile by using some appropriate variables.
	</li>
	<li>Further enhance the Makefile by using implicit rules.
	</li>
	<li>Further enhance the Makefile by writing "clean" as a phony
	    target.
	</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
