Submission Format
=================

1. You have to fill in the files 'paper.tex', 'TwoColumnPaper.tex' and 'Sources/paper.bib' for the dummy paper.

2. All your images should be in 'Sources/Images/' directory and .tex files should be in 'Sources/TexFiles/' directory.
Any other extra files should be in 'Sources/OtherFiles/' directory.

3. We will mainly use 'paper.pdf' and 'TwoColumnPaper.pdf' for evaluation.

4. You are not required to submit .pdf files.

5. Please write the command that you have used(i.e. latex or pdflatex) in the file named 'CommandUsed.txt'. By default it will have 'latex' written in it. If you have used 'pdflatex' then replace latex with pdflatex in this file.

6. Don't forget to rename the directory '<your_roll_no>' with your actual roll no. If your roll no. contains alphabetical letter(i.e., r or R), then use small letters.

7. For final submission, you have to create a single .tar.gz file, using following command,
tar -zcvf <your_roll_no>.tar.gz <path_of_directory_specified_in_6th_point_of_this_file>
