\noindent{This paper proposed a new feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict software effort based on the use case points model. The inputs of the proposed model are software size, productivity and project complexity. To evaluate the ANN model, a multiple linear regression model was developed that has the same inputs as the ANN model. The regression and the ANN models were trained using 168 projects and evaluated using 72 projects. The ANN model was then evaluated against the regression model as well as the Use Case Point model. Results show that the proposed ANN model outperforms the regression and UCP models based on the MMER and PRED criteria and can be used an as alternative method to predict software effort from use case diagrams.\\
Future work will focus on trying other models such as Radial Basis Function Neural Network and General Regression Neural Network.}
