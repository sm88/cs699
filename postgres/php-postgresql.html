<h2>PHP and PostgreSQL Exercises</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Install apache2, postgresql, and php5, if not already installed.
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that apache2 and postgresql are running as background
  daemons.
  </li>
  <li>Write a "Hello World" php script and place it in the appropriate
  www directory (usually /var/www).  Access it via your browser in the
  same machine, and then from a browser in a different machine.
  Ensure that the php script produces the desired output.  This is a
  test that php is installed correctly.
  </li>
  <li>In this exercise, you've to create a web application to manage
  the marks of CS699 students (of course, you'll be dealing with dummy
  marks!).
      <ol class="a">
	<li>Now create a database (called marks_db henceforth; but you can
	    name it anything you want) using the createdb command.  You have to
	    do this as user postgres, unless you've already created a postgres
	    user who has privileges to create databases.
	</li>
	<li>Create a table called "users" in the database, to store information about each
	    student: roll number, name, email address, and a login
  password (for this website, not your LDAP login or NSL/OSL login
  password).  Designate roll number as the primary key for this table.
	</li>
	<li>Create another table called "marks" in the database, to store
  information about each students' marks in: quiz1, midsem, quiz2,
  project, and endsem.  Designate roll number as foreign key into the
  "users" table.
	</li>
	<li>Populate the above tables with at least three entries
  each.  One of the entries in each table has to be corresponding to a
  user called "admin" who has administrator privileges for this
  application.  The marks for the "admin" indicate the maximum
  possible marks in each of the given exams.
	</li>
	<li>First write a test php script to display the number of rows in
  each of the tables.  In this process, you'll discover that the web
  server does not have permissions to access the database tables.
  You have to enable these permissions using the GRANT SQL command so
  that the php script works.
	</li>
	<li>Now create a web form for a user to enter his/her roll
  number and password.  On submitting this form, a php script must be
  run to show the students' marks as a table.  Don't forget to do
  error handling such as: non-existent roll number, password mismatch,
  marks not yet entered, etc.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [3HP]:</span> Enhance the above
  form/script so that when the admin
  logins, the marks of all students are shown as a table.<br />
	    <b>Note:</b> All optional house point questions to be
  shown as demos in lab or to a TA separately.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [up to 10HP]:</span> Enhance the above
  application to allow the admin to change
  the marks of any student.  The best is to allow the admin to do this
  from the above table itself.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> Now enhance the
  above application enabling cookies.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [10HP]:</span> Further enhance
  the application to allow bulk
  upload/update of the "users" or "students" tables from a csv file.
  Be sure to do error handling correctly.
	</li>
	<li><span class="em">Optional [10HP]:</span> Now enhance the
  above application so that when the admin
  updates any students' marks, it emails the particular student with
  the update.
	</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>What to submit?</h3>

<p>Submit a tar-gz of your php scripts, as well as an SQL dump of the
database.  The PostgreSQL manual has information on how to create
this dump.</p>
