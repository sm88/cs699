-When doing stdout redirection to a file, the file is created first and then the command is run,
-Using cat -, causes cat to read from the stdin and when we do a <file.txt it reads the file. This is cat level redirection.
-When we do directly, it is shell level.
- << is used for here-document. It is used to embed data within a script. Example: cat << EOF > out.txt . This'll cause the shell to take input until an EOF is specified.
- control structures like loops and access control blocks can also be redirected from script. Example:
function test(){
	echo "hello"
}>out.txt
- echo command with -n flag DOES NOT create a newline.
- pipes connect the out of a command to in of the other.
- with less and more we can also search for strings. 
Example: 
\bytes
- ctrl+D is EOF for stdin
