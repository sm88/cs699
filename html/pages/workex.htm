	     <h4>work experience</h4>
	     <hr />
	     <p>I have 2 years industrial experience from working at <a href="http://www.csc.com" target="_blank">CSC India Pvt. Ltd</a>. I was working in the healthcare domain for a Denmark Client, as a JAVA Developer. My project was product based and I worked on 5 modules of it.</p>
	     <p>My responsibilities were upto and beyond preparation of design documents, implementation, proof of concept, testing and writing test cases, both JUnit and manual.
	     </p>
	     <p>The very brief details of the modules I worked for are as follows:</p>
	     <table>
	       <tr>
		 <th>Module Name</th>
	         <th>Description</th>
	         <th>Responsibility</th
	       </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>Phrases</td>
		 <td>It was a small administration based functionality that allowed users to create text with rich text formatting (RTF) and then save it for future use in the main project.</td>
		 <td>Implementation in JAVA, Test cases</td>
	       </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>Intervene</td>
		 <td>Involved adding some new operations to existing interface and the corresponding implementation accross the domain.</td>
		 <td>Design Document, Implementation in JAVA, Test cases</td>
	       </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>Plan</td>
		 <td>Enhancement to an extension of Intervene allowing creation of multiple interventions</td>
		 <td>Design Document, Implementation in JAVA, Test cases</td>
	       </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>Loader</td>
		 <td>A sub-project which allows users to load data required for executing JUnit test cases when they are run on a new environment. It helped save hundreds of man-hours</td>
		 <td>Implementation in JAVA</td>
               </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>Intervene Evaluate</td>
		 <td>This required creating an entirely new functionality which allowed a user to evaluate an intervention, for recording various execution outcomes.</td>
		 <td>Design, Documentation, Implementation in JAVA, Test Cases</td>
               </tr> 
	     </table>
	     <p>Apart from this I was also involved in POCs for Code quality monitoring and JAVA Swing UI automated testing tools.</p>
