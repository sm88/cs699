	     <hr />
	     <p>Through the course of my UG I have created many projects, some of which I'd like to mention here with very brief details.</p>
	     <table>
	       <tr>
		 <th>Project</th>
		 <th>Description</th>
		 <th>Semester</th>
	       </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>UCGT-UML to code generation tool</td>
		 <td>This was a JAVA desktop application, which allowed user to create a basic UML class diagram, and then generate the corresponding source classes in C++</td>
		 <td>V</td>
	       </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>UrNetwork</td>
		 <td>This was a social networking website, which was created as a Minor project. It had all the basic features like sending notes, status updates, themes, games, friends, photos and a shoutbox. I used PHP and MySql as backend and HTML, CSS, Javascript for frontend.</td>
		 <td>V</td>
               </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>JLMFSC</td>
		 <td>Java Lan Messaging and File Sharing Client. It was also a JAVA desktop application, which allowed users on a LAN to identify each other and send messages, chat, play tic-tac-toe or send files to each other. This made heavy use of socket programming and multi-threading</td>
		 <td>VI</td>
	       </tr>
	       <tr>
		 <td>Emotion Identification</td>
		 <td>This was my final year project. The objective was to identify various facial features of a human face from a live video dfeed and then try and identify what emotion was he portraying. The emotion identification made use of machine learning. This was made in C language and I used OpenCV for image manipulation and LibSVM for classification.</td>
		 <td>VII, VIII</td>
